# RoadScan

 The program logs the spectrum of a selected RF band in
relation to the GPS position of the measurement antenna. It simultaneously reads out GPS position from a USB-connected GPS receiver and signal levels from the FSH6 spectrum analyzer and then logs both in the file. For every position a picture of the spectrum
is created. There is also the maplayer.py utility for creating a KML file of measurement.The program logs spectrum of an selected RF band in
